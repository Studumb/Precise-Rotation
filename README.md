# Precise-Rotation

### About
- Adds precise part rotation with user-defined input based on the XYZ axis

### Plan
- This is currently an unfinished project please check it out later, but the full release of the mod should contain precise rotation and maybe precise offset
- There's no release date since I can't ensure about it. Mostly, because of the lack of time I can spend on the project.
